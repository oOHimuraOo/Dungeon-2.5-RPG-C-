# Godot C# Game

This game was made with the Godot Engine using only C#. It was part of an activity in a course provided by GameDev.Tv. It is a simple game and doesn't have a lot of gameplay mechanics, but it is a good proof of concept.

## Features Implemented
- Enemy state machine
- Player state machine
- Dynamic lighting
- Enemy pathfinding
- Player abilities
- Environment particles
- Shader

## Disclaimer
This game does not have a complete game loop. I made this only to see the difference between using GDScript to make a game and C#. Now knowing that I prefer GDScript, I don't see a benefit in pursuing a complete loop for this game. I learned a lot while using C# to make this game, but for me, while crafting a game in Godot, I will continue to use GDScript.
